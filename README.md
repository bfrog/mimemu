# Mimemu

A heapless musically inclined audio pipeline

## Why

There are many audio processing libraries out there but few of them allow
usage on a high powered microcontroller and none were written in Rust allowing
greater expressive power to build the audio processing pipes.

The goal of this library is to provide all the basic tools needed to build a
digitally defined modular synthesizer and sampler usable even on a Cortex-M
microcontroller.
